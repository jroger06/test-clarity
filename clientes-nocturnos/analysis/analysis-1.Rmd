# Clarity R Analysis

This is the template where you should start building your analysis using **Clarity**. Do not erase the imports and **use the Clarity SDK** to build queries and access Hive and Impala.
_You can safely delete this text when you are ready to start working on your analysis._

```{r message=FALSE}
# Declare all the imports here
library(clarity)
```

```{r}
# Start you analysis here!
```
